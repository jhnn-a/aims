# Assets Device Ownership Display Fix

## Issue

The Deployed Assets section in `Assets.js` was displaying the **Employee's Client** (from `employee.clientId`) instead of the **Device's Owner** (from `device.client` field). This caused confusion about who actually owns the device.

### Previous Behavior

- Used `getEmployeeClient(device.assignedTo)` which:
  1. Looked up the employee by `device.assignedTo`
  2. Retrieved the employee's `clientId`
  3. Returned the client name from the employee's client affiliation
- This showed which client the employee works for, NOT which client owns the device

### Problem Example

- A device owned by "Joii Philippines" assigned to an employee who works for "Client ABC"
- Would incorrectly show "Client ABC" in the Client column
- This confused the actual ownership of the device

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Created New Helper Function** (`getDeviceOwner`)
   - Returns `device.client` field directly
   - Falls back to "Joii Philippines" if client field is empty/null
   - Located after line 1072 in Assets.js

```javascript
const getDeviceOwner = (device) => {
  if (!device) return "";
  return device.client || "Joii Philippines";
};
```

2. **Updated Table Cell Rendering** (Line ~3301)

   - Changed from: `getEmployeeClient(device.assignedTo)`
   - Changed to: `getDeviceOwner(device)`
   - Now shows the actual device owner from `device.client` field

3. **Updated Filter Logic** (Line ~1358)

   - Changed client filter to use `getDeviceOwner(device)`
   - Ensures filtering works with actual device ownership
   - Maintains search functionality for both client names and "Joii Philippines"

4. **Updated Column Header** (Line ~2719)
   - Changed from: "Client"
   - Changed to: "Device Owner"
   - Provides clearer indication of what the column represents

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Ownership Display**

   - Shows actual device owner (from device.client field)
   - Clearly identifies Joii Philippines-owned vs client-owned devices

2. **Consistency with Inventory**

   - Aligns with `Inventory.js` which displays `device.client` directly
   - Same ownership logic across both modules

3. **Clear Company Assets**

   - Devices without a client assignment now show "Joii Philippines"
   - Easy to identify company-owned assets

4. **Better Filtering**
   - Can filter by actual device owner
   - Distinguishes between employee's client and device owner

## Technical Details

### Device Data Model

- `device.client`: The client who owns the device (or empty for Joii Philippines)
- `device.assignedTo`: The employee ID to whom the device is assigned
- `employee.clientId`: The client for whom the employee works

### Display Logic

- **Device Owner Column**: Shows `device.client || "Joii Philippines"`
- **Assigned To Column**: Shows employee name (unchanged)
- Separates device ownership from employee assignment

### Backward Compatibility

- Devices without `client` field will default to "Joii Philippines"
- Existing devices with client field will display correctly
- No database migration needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Ownership Display**

   - Check devices owned by clients show client name
   - Check devices owned by Joii Philippines show "Joii Philippines"
   - Verify assigned employee is still shown correctly

2. **Test Filtering**

   - Filter by client name (should show client-owned devices)
   - Filter by "Joii Philippines" (should show company-owned devices)
   - Verify search works with partial matches

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Unassigned devices (no assignedTo)
   - Devices with empty client field
   - Devices assigned to employees from different clients

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/Assets.js`
  - Added `getDeviceOwner()` helper function
  - Updated table cell rendering (line ~3301)
  - Updated filter logic (line ~1358)
  - Updated column header (line ~2719)
