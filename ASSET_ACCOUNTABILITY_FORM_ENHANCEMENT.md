# Asset Accountability Form Options Enhancement

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the enhanced Asset Accountability Form Options for the Inventory assignment modal with radio button controls and improved user experience.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Radio Button Implementation
- **New Issue**: Now has a radio button that must be selected to enable its options
- **Work From Home/Borrowed**: Now has a radio button that must be selected to enable its options
- Radio buttons are mutually exclusive - only one can be selected at a time

### 2. Checkbox Logic Enhancement

#### New Issue Section:
- **Newly Purchased** checkbox: Enabled only when "New Issue" radio button is selected
- **Stock** checkbox: Enabled only when "New Issue" radio button is selected
- **Auto-selection Logic**: When "Newly Purchased" is checked, "Stock" is automatically checked and disabled
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled checkboxes are grayed out with reduced opacity

#### Work From Home/Borrowed Section:
- **Newly Purchased** checkbox: Enabled only when "Work From Home/Borrowed" radio button is selected  
- **Stock** checkbox: Enabled only when "Work From Home/Borrowed" radio button is selected
- **Auto-selection Logic**: When "Newly Purchased" is checked, "Stock" is automatically checked and disabled
- **Visual Feedback**: Disabled checkboxes are grayed out with reduced opacity

### 3. Removed Features
- **Temporary Deploy checkbox**: Completely removed from the interface
- **Temporary Deploy logic**: Removed from document generation and device assignment logic

### 4. Enhanced Validation
- Users must select either "New Issue" or "Work From Home/Borrowed" radio button
- Users must select at least one checkbox option for their chosen radio button selection
- Clear error messages guide users when validation fails

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Structure Changes
```javascript
const [assignModalChecks, setAssignModalChecks] = useState({
  // Radio button selections
  issueTypeSelected: "", // "newIssue" or "wfh"
  // Checkbox states
  newIssueNew: false,
  newIssueStock: false,
  wfhNew: false,
  wfhStock: false,
});
```

### New Handler Functions

#### Radio Button Handler
```javascript
const handleAssignModalRadio = (issueType) => {
  setAssignModalChecks((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    issueTypeSelected: issueType,
    // Reset all checkboxes when radio button changes
    newIssueNew: false,
    newIssueStock: false,
    wfhNew: false,
    wfhStock: false,
  }));
};
```

#### Enhanced Checkbox Handler
```javascript
const handleAssignModalCheckbox = (e) => {
  const { name, checked } = e.target;
  
  setAssignModalChecks((prev) => {
    const newState = { ...prev };
    
    // Handle Newly Purchased logic
    if (name === "newIssueNew" || name === "wfhNew") {
      newState[name] = checked;
      
      if (checked) {
        // Auto-select Stock when Newly Purchased is selected
        if (name === "newIssueNew") {
          newState.newIssueStock = true;
        } else if (name === "wfhNew") {
          newState.wfhStock = true;
        }
      }
    } else if (name === "newIssueStock" || name === "wfhStock") {
      // Only allow unchecking Stock if Newly Purchased is not selected
      const newlyPurchasedField = name === "newIssueStock" ? "newIssueNew" : "wfhNew";
      if (!prev[newlyPurchasedField]) {
        newState[name] = checked;
      }
      // If Newly Purchased is selected, Stock remains checked (disabled behavior)
    }
    
    return newState;
  });
};
```

### Enhanced Validation Logic
```javascript
const handleAssignModalNext = () => {
  // Validate that either New Issue or Work From Home is selected
  if (!assignModalChecks.issueTypeSelected) {
    showError("Please select either 'New Issue' or 'Work From Home/Borrowed' option.");
    return;
  }
  
  // Validate that at least one checkbox is selected for the chosen issue type
  if (assignModalChecks.issueTypeSelected === "newIssue") {
    if (!assignModalChecks.newIssueNew && !assignModalChecks.newIssueStock) {
      showError("Please select at least one option for New Issue (Newly Purchased or Stock).");
      return;
    }
  } else if (assignModalChecks.issueTypeSelected === "wfh") {
    if (!assignModalChecks.wfhNew && !assignModalChecks.wfhStock) {
      showError("Please select at least one option for Work From Home/Borrowed (Newly Purchased or Stock).");
      return;
    }
  }
  
  setAssignModalShowGenerate(true);
};
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Clear Visual Hierarchy
- Radio buttons for main categories are prominently displayed
- Sub-options (checkboxes) are indented and visually grouped under their parent radio button

### 2. Disabled State Feedback
- Disabled checkboxes have reduced opacity (0.5)
- Text color changes to gray (#9ca3af) for disabled options
- Cursor changes to "not-allowed" for disabled elements

### 3. Smart Auto-Selection
- When "Newly Purchased" is selected, "Stock" is automatically checked
- When "Newly Purchased" is selected, "Stock" checkbox becomes disabled to prevent unchecking
- When "Newly Purchased" is unchecked, "Stock" checkbox becomes enabled again

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Clear validation messages inform users about required selections
- Validation prevents progression without proper selections

## Benefits

1. **Better User Guidance**: Radio buttons make it clear that only one main option can be selected
2. **Prevented Errors**: Auto-selection logic ensures proper combinations
3. **Streamlined Interface**: Removal of temporary deploy option simplifies choices
4. **Consistent Experience**: All assignment types follow the same interaction pattern
5. **Clear Validation**: Users receive helpful feedback when selections are incomplete

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Inventory.js` - Complete modal interface and logic enhancement

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Radio Button Selection**: Verify only one radio button can be selected at a time
2. **Checkbox Enablement**: Test that checkboxes are only enabled when their parent radio button is selected
3. **Auto-Selection Logic**: Verify that selecting "Newly Purchased" automatically selects and disables "Stock"
4. **Validation**: Test that appropriate error messages appear for incomplete selections
5. **Document Generation**: Confirm that generated documents reflect the correct selections
6. **State Reset**: Verify that changing radio buttons resets checkbox selections appropriately

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing assignment functionality is preserved
- Document generation maintains the same format and structure
- Database operations remain unchanged
