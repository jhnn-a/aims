# Asset Change Tracking Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the Asset History system to track and display specific field changes when assets are updated. Now when you change any field (like Condition from "GOOD" to "DEFECTIVE"), the history will show exactly what changed.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

#### 1. Assets.js

- **Added `getDeviceChanges()` function** (lines ~1499-1534)
  - Compares old and new device data
  - Tracks changes across all relevant fields
  - Returns structured changes object: `{ fieldName: { old: value, new: value } }`
- **Updated `handleSave()` function** (lines ~1536-1571)
  - Retrieves original device data before update
  - Calls `getDeviceChanges()` to detect modifications
  - Logs history with structured changes object
  - Only logs if changes are detected

#### 2. Inventory.js

- **Updated `getDeviceChanges()` function** (lines ~2315-2345)
  - Changed from returning string description to structured object
  - Added more fields to track (CPU, RAM, drives, GPU, OS, etc.)
  - Returns `{ fieldName: { old: value, new: value } }` format
- **Updated `handleSave()` for serial number path** (lines ~2674-2713)
  - Uses structured changes object for history logging
  - Converts changes to readable description for User Logs
- **Updated `handleSave()` for non-serial path** (lines ~2782-2821)
  - Same structured changes approach
  - Maintains consistency across both code paths

#### 3. deviceHistoryService.js (Already Supported)

- The `logDeviceHistory()` function already accepts `changes` parameter
- The `formatHistoryEntry()` function already formats changes for display
- Format: `"Field Name: 'old value' → 'new value'"`

## Tracked Fields

The following fields are now tracked for changes:

### Basic Information

- Device Type
- Device Tag
- Brand
- Model
- Client
- Serial Number

### Status & Condition

- Condition (e.g., GOOD → DEFECTIVE)
- Acquisition Date
- Assigned To

### Technical Specifications (for PCs/Laptops)

- CPU
- CPU Generation
- RAM
- Primary Drive (Drive1)
- Secondary Drive (Drive2)
- GPU
- Operating System

### Additional Fields

- Category
- Lifespan
- Remarks

## How It Works

### Example Flow:

1. **User edits a device** in Assets.js or Inventory.js
2. **System captures original values** before save
3. **User changes Condition** from "GOOD" to "DEFECTIVE"
4. **System compares** old vs new data
5. **Generates changes object:**
   ```javascript
   {
     condition: {
       old: "GOOD",
       new: "DEFECTIVE"
     }
   }
   ```
6. **Logs to device history** with structured changes
7. **History displays** in Asset History modal:
   ```
   Asset Information Updated
   12/15/2024 at 10:30 AM
   • Condition: "GOOD" → "DEFECTIVE"
   ```

### Multiple Changes Example:

If user changes multiple fields at once:

```javascript
{
  condition: { old: "GOOD", new: "DEFECTIVE" },
  remarks: { old: "(empty)", new: "Screen damage" },
  ram: { old: "8GB", new: "16GB" }
}
```

Displays as:

```
Asset Information Updated
12/15/2024 at 10:30 AM
• Condition: "GOOD" → "DEFECTIVE"
• Remarks: "(empty)" → "Screen damage"
• Ram: "8GB" → "16GB"
```

## Display Format

### In Asset History Modal:

- **Title**: "Asset Information Updated"
- **Timestamp**: MM/DD/YYYY at HH:MM AM/PM
- **Details**: Bullet-pointed list of changes
  - Each line shows: `Field Name: "old value" → "new value"`
  - Empty values shown as "(empty)"
  - Field names are automatically formatted (camelCase → Proper Case)

## Testing

### To Test Change Tracking:

1. **Open Assets.js or Inventory.js**
2. **Select any device** and click Edit
3. **Change one or more fields:**
   - Change Condition from "GOOD" to "DEFECTIVE"
   - Update Remarks
   - Modify RAM or other specs
4. **Click Save**
5. **View Asset History** for that device
6. **Verify** the latest entry shows:
   - Action: "Asset Information Updated"
   - Specific changes listed with old → new values
   - Correct timestamp

### Test Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Single Field Change

- Change Condition: GOOD → DEFECTIVE
- Expected: History shows "Condition: 'GOOD' → 'DEFECTIVE'"

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Field Changes

- Change Condition: GOOD → DEFECTIVE
- Change Remarks: "" → "Keyboard not working"
- Expected: History shows both changes as separate bullets

#### Scenario 3: Empty Values

- Change Remarks from "Test" to empty
- Expected: Shows "Remarks: 'Test' → '(empty)'"

#### Scenario 4: No Changes

- Open edit form, don't change anything, save
- Expected: No history entry created (or entry with "No changes detected")

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Audit Trail** - See exactly what changed and when
✅ **Accountability** - Track who modified what fields
✅ **Troubleshooting** - Identify when issues started (e.g., when condition changed to DEFECTIVE)
✅ **Compliance** - Meet audit requirements for asset tracking
✅ **User-Friendly** - Clear, readable change descriptions
✅ **Comprehensive** - Tracks all important fields, not just basic info

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With:

- ✅ Asset History modal in Assets.js
- ✅ Asset History modal in Inventory.js
- ✅ History sorting (newest first)
- ✅ Invalid date handling ("Invalid Date" markers)
- ✅ All action types (assigned, unassigned, updated, etc.)
- ✅ User Logs system (separate simplified format)

### Compatible With:

- ✅ UnitSpecs sync
- ✅ Employee assignment tracking
- ✅ Firestore database structure
- ✅ Existing history service functions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future updates:

1. **Field-Level Highlighting** - Highlight changed fields in the edit form
2. **Change Notifications** - Alert users when critical fields change
3. **Rollback Capability** - Allow reverting to previous values
4. **Change Comparison View** - Side-by-side before/after view
5. **Export Changes** - Include change details in Excel exports
6. **Change Filters** - Filter history by specific field changes
7. **Change Statistics** - Show most frequently changed fields

## Notes

- Changes are only logged when fields actually differ
- Empty string values are displayed as "(empty)" for clarity
- Field names are automatically formatted for readability
- Changes object is also passed to User Logs (in simplified string format)
- No history entry is created if no fields changed
- All existing history entries remain unaffected (backward compatible)
