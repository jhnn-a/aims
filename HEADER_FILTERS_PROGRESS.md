I'll help you implement header-level filters for all tables in the system. I've started with the Inventory table and now need to continue with the Assets table.

## Progress Summary:

### âœ… Completed:
1. **TableHeaderFilters Component** - Created reusable filter components:
   - `TextFilter` - For string-based columns
   - `DropdownFilter` - For categorical data
   - `DateFilter` - For date fields
   - `useTableFilters` hook - For managing filter state
   - `applyFilters` utility - For applying filters to data

2. **Inventory Table** - Implemented header filters:
   - Added header filters import
   - Added filter state management
   - Updated filtering logic to combine global search + header filters
   - Added dual-row header (titles + filters)
   - Added filter status indicator
   - Updated pagination to work with filters

3. **Assets Table** - Implemented header filters:
   - Added header filters import
   - Added filter state management
   - Updated filtering logic to combine global search + header filters
   - Added dual-row header (titles + filters) with all filter inputs
   - Added filter status indicator with clear all functionality
   - Pagination already working with `filteredDevices.length`

### ï¿½ In Progress:
4. **Employee Database Table** - Not started

### ðŸ“‹ TODO:
5. **Other tables** - Need to identify and implement
6. **Testing & Refinement** - Ensure consistency across all tables

## Next Steps:
1. Implement Employee Database table filters
2. Identify and implement filters for any other tables in the system
3. Add responsive design considerations
4. Test performance with large datasets
5. Ensure accessibility compliance

The filtering system supports:
- Real-time filtering as user types
- Multiple concurrent filters
- Filter status indicators
- Clear all filters functionality
- Consistent Maax font styling
- Responsive design considerations

**Assets Table Implementation Complete!** âœ…

The Assets table now has comprehensive header-level filtering with:
- Device Tag, Type, Brand, Model, Assigned To, Date Assigned, Condition, and Remarks filters
- Dual-row header design (titles + filters)
- Filter status display with active filter count
- Clear all filters functionality
- Proper integration with existing global search

Ready to proceed with Employee Database table implementation.
