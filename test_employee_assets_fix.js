console.log("\n📊 FILTER COMPARISON:");
console.log(`Employee: ${testEmployee.fullName} (ID: ${testEmployee.id})`);
console.log(`\n❌ OLD FILTER (Broken):`);
console.log(`   Found ${oldDeployedAssets.length} deployed assets`);
oldDeployedAssets.forEach((device) => {
  console.log(`   - ${device.deviceTag} (${device.deviceType})`);
});

console.log(`\n✅ NEW FILTER (Fixed):`);
console.log(`   Found ${newDeployedAssets.length} deployed assets`);
newDeployedAssets.forEach((device) => {
  console.log(`   - ${device.deviceTag} (${device.deviceType})`);
});

console.log("\n🔍 ANALYSIS:");
console.log('- Old filter required assignmentType === "newIssue"');
console.log("- But assignmentType is never set when devices are assigned");
console.log("- New filter only checks if assignedTo matches employee ID");
console.log("- This matches how Assets.js identifies assigned devices");

console.log("\n🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:");
console.log("✅ When devices are assigned to employees in Assets.js:");
console.log("   1. Device gets assignedTo field set to employee ID");
console.log("   2. Device appears in Assets.js as assigned");
console.log(
  "   3. Device now appears in Employee.js Asset History > Deployed Assets"
);
console.log("   4. No more missing deployed assets!");

console.log("\n📝 NEXT STEPS:");
console.log("1. Test the fix by checking an employee with assigned devices");
console.log("2. Verify deployed assets now appear in Asset History");
console.log("3. Confirm consistency between Assets.js and Employee.js views");
